# DSPL-Cancer-2022-Dashboard-Project
Streamlit Dashboard for DSPL Individual Coursework 2025

This project comprises an interactive web-based dashboard created using **Streamlit** to visualize and analyze cancer incidence data for **Sri Lanka (2020)**. It forms part of the **Data Science Project Lifecycle (DSPL)** individual coursework.


## Data

**Source** - National Cancer Control Programme (NCCP), Sri Lanka

**Report** - Annual Cancer Incidence Report 2020

**Description** - Total number of cancer cases by **cancer type** and **gender (Male/Female)**

**Method** - Data was collected as manually entered from tables 15-31 of the NCCP report, as there was no available API or machine-readable format. 


## Visualizations 

1.Cancer Cases Total (Metric) 

2.Top 10 cancer cases types (Horizontal bar chart) 

3.No of cancer cases by type (with line chart overlaid) 

4.Distribution of Cancer Cases (Histogram) 

5.Distribution of Cancer cases by Gender (Donut chart) 

6.Top 5 - Male cases types of cancer (Bar chart) 

7.Top 5 - Female cases types of cancer (Bar chart) 

8.No of cancer cases Male and Female (grouped bar chart) 

9.Types of cancer with low cases (below 10) 

10.Average cases per type of cancer (Scatter plot)
